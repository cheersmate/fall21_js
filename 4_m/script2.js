WARNING!!! WARNING!!!


var names = ["Yaakov", "John", "Jen", "Jason", "Paul", "Frank", "Larry", "Paula", "Laura", "Jim"];



//STEP 15: 
//b.In the main script.js, use the map function to create an array based on the names array.
//This array will contain the greetings based on the names with the same rules 
//as implemented previously.The function passed into the map function should not 
//be an inline function, i.e., separate it into its own named function and pass 
//it into the mapfunction as a value. The end result should be that the list prints out twice in the browser console after you complete this part.


//STEP 17: 
//a.You already implemented speakSimple method at this point.You will use that method in this part as well.
//b. In the main script.js, use the reduce function to create 2 separate arrays: 
//one with all the ‘hello’ greetings and another with all the good bye greetings.
// Then, loop over each array (obviously separately) and print out the greetings 
//to the console with console.log. You are required to use {hello: [], bye: []} as your initialValue.
// (Kind of a hint, isn’t it?). The end result should be that the list prints out 3 times. The 3rd time, it will print each group of greetings separately (‘hello’ and ‘good bye’).
